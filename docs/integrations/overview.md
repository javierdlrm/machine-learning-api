## Hopsworks

If you are using Spark or Python within Hopsworks, there is no further configuration required. Head over to the Getting Started guides for [Model Registry](../model-registry/quickstart.md) and [Model Serving](../model-serving/quickstart.md).

## External Python environment (Local)

Connecting to the Model Management (Registry and Serving) from any Python environment, such as your local environment, requires setting up a Model Management API Key and installing the HSML Python client library. The [Python integration guide](python.md) explains step by step how to connect to the Model Management from any Python environment.
